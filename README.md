# MSA 2019: Cognitive Services Submission by Gemma Lowe

For my 2019 MSA submission for Cognitive Services I created an application written with javascript, html, css and react utilising several different units of Microsoft Cognitive Services.

This apps purpose could be to use in a dating app where you want to have some level of confirmation that images uploaded are of the user. To do this the user first must upload images of themself, at maximum four. Then they must perform a series of emotions to confirm they are a human and then if these emotions are performed successfully the uploaded images will verified to the user and if the images match a verified status will be applied. All this is done with images taken from the users video camera.

I have utilised calls to detect and verify in the Face API and to get thumbnail in the computer vision API. I have used detectt to retrieve Face ID's of images and screenshots and to extract their emotion values. I used get thumbnail so all uploaded images have same aspect ratio and can be displayed in a nicer manner space wise, and focusing on the region of interest of the image. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
